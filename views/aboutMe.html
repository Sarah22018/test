        My name is Sarah Crawford I am 15 years old. My birthday is in December.
        I am an only child unless you count our cat and nine chickens. One thing
        that I love to do is read. I almost always have a book on the go. My
        favorite genres are fantasy and sci-fi. I have been doing karate for
        over 7 years and have earned my purple belt. I enjoy karate but I am not
        a very athletic pearson.

        I like to travel, though I haven't done a whole lot of it and I can get
        motion sickness. I have been to florida twice, alberta, PEI on a camping
        trip, mexico, this year we towed are trailer across the border to new
        york and camped at darien lake spending 3 days in six flags parks. Even
        though I am afraid of rollercoasters I managed to go on one. This year I
        am going onj the schools history trip to London, Paris, and Amsterdam. I
        am getting all the tips from my aunt who travels all the time.

        I have been doing robotics for over four years now and I have learned
        how to build and design a robot. I learned about gear ratios, and how to
        use a saw. I also learned the basics of C++ coding language, I hope to
        learn more about it this year.
