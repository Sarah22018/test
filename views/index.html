    <p class="center">Welcome To my CCT of my class ICS3U</p>

    <p>
      We did many things this year including learning how to code Html on glitch
      and Javascript on Vidcode. We also learned how to use a raspberry pi and a
      3D printer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first Project we did was making an about me page wich is right here.
      <a href="/aboutMe">Learn about me</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the year we made things look a litle less like the 90's and
      mooved on to bootstrap. Wich you can see <a href="/bootstrap">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then learned how to make alerts apear wich I might have taken a little
      overboard on. Beware if you press this <a href="/alerts">Link</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every kid loves pressing <a href="/buttons">Buttons</a> There were
      multiple vershions of things like this. like the text being stored in
      <a href="/functions">Functions</a> or buttons stored with in an
      exlernal.JS file. That vershion is found <a href="/buttons2">Here</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="center2">Moving on to vidcode</p>
    <p>
      We did many things on vidcode this year but I would say my favorit is
      <a href="/quiz">this</a>. However I defintly did not start with something
      that complecated. It looked more like <a href="/filter">This</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving on from filters we learned to <a href="/draw">Draw</a>. To make
      things change using <a href="/array">arrays</a>. To creating a news
      <a href="/news">Segment</a>. We also made a things follow the mouse and
      dispaer along with <a href="/cat">reappearing</a>. Another great project
      was the emoji <a href="/emojibattle">war</a>, you never knew who would
      win.
    </p>
    <p>
      However the big projects were the final projects. I have previosly
      metioned some of them but here is all of them. Butt you can find all of
      them <a href="/all">here</a>

          <h3>3D printing</h3>
          <p>
            3D printing was lots of fun. I was ourgnally going to use it in my
            self design project but then that chaged, so I am no longer using it
            for that. But in the proses of testing I discoverd you did not want
            to make anything biger then 13 inches. I a ttempted to make
            something 15 inches. That ended badly. In tinker cad I did make a
            phone stand that allows you to charge the phone as well.
            Unfortantally I did not print it. however I do have a photo of the
            model.

          <h3>The Raspberry Pi</h3>
          <p>
            The raspberry pi was an entirely new concept to me, and was very
            intresting to learn. I did struggle with it but it became a
            challenge. Somethings we did was make a light turn on with a button.
            How to host a website and how to push it to git hub. Unfortanltly I
            can not show you the link to these beacuse the raspberry pi is not
            runing 24/7 however here are some pictures.
